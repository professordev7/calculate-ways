# objective
Problem:
 One person can climb a tower stairs in each time 1 step or 2 steps or pulling 5steps using
 rope. <br />
 Write a program that gets the n as input from the user and count
 the ways up to the n and print it. <br />
 NOTE: The initial place considered as zero. <br />
Implement a program to calculate the ways.

- Inputs
    1.  Only get the n number:<br />
        1 <= n <= 30 <br />
- Output
    Only print the ways to the nth stair.

> Sample1: <br />
- Inputs: <br />
    7 <br />

- Output: <br />
    26 <br />



## Compile
To compile the code execute the below command in the cli:

```bash
$ javac Core.java
```

## Execution
After compilation, the .java file translated to the .class file which is bytecode.
Now we can run the program using the below command in the cli:

```bash
$ java Core
```
